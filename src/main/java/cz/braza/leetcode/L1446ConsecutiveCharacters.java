Hint
The power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Given a string s, return the power of s.



Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
